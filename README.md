Scrollbar Anywhere
==================

An extension for Google Chrome that makes it possible to to scroll pages as if the scrollbar was right under your pointer. Just press the configured mouse button and move the mouse.

If you want grab-and-drag style scrolling, just set it up in the options.

The extension is based on the [Wet Banana extension](https://github.com/jedediah/wetbanana) and inspired by Scrollbar Anywhere for Firefox.
